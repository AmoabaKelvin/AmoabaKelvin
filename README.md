### Hey, I'm Kelvin. 

I'm doing quite a few things, building where i can and most importantly, working and studying a lot on Cloud Engineering and the whole Devopsy kinda field. It's quite an interesting field and it's really lovely.

People usually ask me what I think about this field and how i managed to know what i know now. Albeit we are all quite new, below are my two cents:



### My two cents
To be the best, you just gotta lock in, like really lock in.

It's locking in that has made me realize all the pretty interesting things that we always skip because we are in a rush to learn the latest frameworks or use the latest tools.

You gotta decide, do you want to be a Software Engineer or you want to be a fancy framework engineer. Real engineers are always after the core stuff!

**Put things aside, focus, grind and it'll pay off.**

Look into low level stuff, don't listen to the notion of don't build from scratch, build everything from scratch, read RFCs, re-implement them. That's the only way to get better dawg

Sit, take a look at your life, and lock in, forget things that are happening on the side, the world always rewards those who know what they are doing and individuals who invest time to learn
